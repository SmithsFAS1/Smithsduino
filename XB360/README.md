This is a program for hooking up a TSOP IR Receiver to an Arduino board (in my case a LOLIN S2 Mini) and using it as a virtual keyboard device for an Amazon Fire Stick (a 4K for me)

It was built with a TSOP38238 (https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832658861424.html) plugged into GPIO 7 / 3.3V / GND and allows a Comcast Remote to be programmed as an Xbox 360 Media Controller for buttons to be used in Kodi on a Fire Stick (along with the regular Amazon UI)

A USB Y-Cable OTG adapter was used (https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Amazon-Android-Tablet/dp/B08DQVKGZ5/) for this as well.
